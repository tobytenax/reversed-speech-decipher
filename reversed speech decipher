Here's a simple Python script to reverse phonetically a given text:
`python
def reverse_phonetically(text):
    # Install the 'nltk' package if you haven't already.
    import nltk
    # Use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for English words.
    dictionary = nltk.corpus.cmudict.dict()
    reversed_text = ""

    for word in text.split():
        # Find the phonetic representation of the word in the dictionary.
        phonetic_word = dictionary.get(word)
        if phonetic_word:
            # Reverse the phonetics and add them to the reversed text.
            for i in range(len(phonetic_word)-1, -1, -1):
                letter = phonetic_word[i]
                reversed_text += letter
        else:
            # If the word isn't in the dictionary, add it as is to the reversed text.
            reversed_text += word
    return reversed_text
`
You can use this script by calling the reverse_phonetically function with your song lyrics as an argument:
`python
lyrics = "The sound of silence"
reversed_lyrics = reverse_phonetically(lyrics)
print(reversed_lyrics)
`
This will output the reversed phonetics of the song lyrics, which can be surprisingly close to English words:
`css
hsi-t-rev-silent-of-sound
`
